Reference to this example: https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/xyz.html

In the URL http://localhost:5173/?miss=1, you can see that the double-click event is not triggered.

In the URL http://localhost:5173/, you can see that the double-click event is triggered.

This issue also occurs in other examples, such as https://openlayers.org/en/v9.2.4/examples/xyz.html.

Sorry for borrowing the API key, I promise that I will not use it for any other purposes.
